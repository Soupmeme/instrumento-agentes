# LOGBOOK (Bitacora)

Experiments, decisions, tests and rehearsals, with dates. Kiwi writes scores and reflections himself.

## 2026-09-29, M0 scaffold (andamiaje)

- Built the Vite + TypeScript scaffold: WebGPU device init, clear-to-color render loop, fps HUD, song picker, fullscreen, device-lost recovery.
- Verified on a real WebGPU adapter (Chrome in the Claude desktop app, NVIDIA Lovelace, `timestamp-query` available): device created, canvas cleared, 0 validation errors, no console errors after removing `powerPreference`.
- Verified: a generated WAV loaded through the file input, showed its name and duration, and the audio clock advanced during playback (0.75 s in 0.8 s).
- Not verified: device-lost recovery (needs a forced loss, planned for M8), the fullscreen toggle (needs a user gesture the test harness cannot give), and any other GPU or browser.
- Note: the built-in browser could not click the native audio controls, so playback was tested through the element's API after a real page click.
